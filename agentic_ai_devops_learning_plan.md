## 7. Sample Code and Step-by-Step Implementation: Self-Healing Kubernetes Agent

### Overview
This section provides a sample code structure and step-by-step guide for implementing a Self-Healing Kubernetes Agent. The agent monitors pod/node health, detects failures, and automatically remediates issues using the Kubernetes API.

### Step-by-Step Implementation

#### Step 1: Set Up Your Environment
- Install the Kubernetes Python client:
  ```bash
  pip install kubernetes
  ```
- Ensure you have a valid kubeconfig file (usually located at `~/.kube/config`).

#### Step 2: Basic Agent Structure
Create a file named `self_healing_agent.py` with the following structure:

```python
from kubernetes import client, config
import time
import logging

# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')

class SelfHealingAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        # Load kubeconfig
        config.load_kube_config()
        self.v1 = client.CoreV1Api()
        self.apps_v1 = client.AppsV1Api()
        logging.info("Self-Healing Agent initialized.")

    def observe(self):
        # Observe pod and node health
        pods = self.v1.list_pod_for_all_namespaces(watch=False)
        nodes = self.v1.list_node(watch=False)
        return pods, nodes

    def decide(self, pods, nodes):
        # Decide if remediation is needed
        unhealthy_pods = [pod for pod in pods.items if pod.status.phase == 'Failed']
        unhealthy_nodes = [node for node in nodes.items if node.status.conditions[0].type == 'Ready' and node.status.conditions[0].status == 'False']
        return unhealthy_pods, unhealthy_nodes

    def act(self, unhealthy_pods, unhealthy_nodes):
        # Take remediation actions
        for pod in unhealthy_pods:
            logging.info(f"Restarting pod: {pod.metadata.name} in namespace {pod.metadata.namespace}")
            self.v1.delete_namespaced_pod(pod.metadata.name, pod.metadata.namespace)
        for node in unhealthy_nodes:
            logging.info(f"Node {node.metadata.name} is unhealthy. Consider manual intervention.")

    def run(self, interval=60):
        # Main loop
        while True:
            pods, nodes = self.observe()
            unhealthy_pods, unhealthy_nodes = self.decide(pods, nodes)
            self.act(unhealthy_pods, unhealthy_nodes)
            time.sleep(interval)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    agent = SelfHealingAgent()
    agent.run()
```

#### Step 3: Explanation of the Code
- **Initialization:** The agent loads the Kubernetes configuration and initializes the API client.
- **Observe:** The `observe` method fetches the current state of pods and nodes.
- **Decide:** The `decide` method checks for unhealthy pods (status 'Failed') and nodes (status 'Not Ready').
- **Act:** The `act` method restarts unhealthy pods and logs unhealthy nodes for manual intervention.
- **Run:** The `run` method executes the observe-decide-act loop at a specified interval.

#### Step 4: Run the Agent
- Execute the script:
  ```bash
  python self_healing_agent.py
  ```
- Monitor the logs for agent actions and remediation events.

#### Step 5: Extensions and Improvements
- **Add RL-based Decision Making:** Integrate a reinforcement learning model to optimize remediation actions.
- **Enhance Observability:** Integrate with Prometheus/Grafana for richer metrics and dashboards.
- **Implement Alerting:** Send notifications (e.g., via Slack or email) for critical events.

### Additional Tips
- Start with a simple rules-based agent, then iterate to add learning and autonomy as you gain confidence.
- Test the agent in a non-production environment first to ensure safe remediation actions.
